### Overview
- The problem is to predict anomaly based on the readings captured by sensors.

 ### Objective: 
- Evaluate candidates on their ability to work with tabular data, perform advanced analysis, and build robust predictive models.
• Format: Individual participation
• Deliverables: Jupyter Notebook with code

### Evaluation Criteria
• Data Exploration and Preprocessing (20%):
o Handling missing values, outliers
o Feature engineering and correlation analysis

• Modeling (60%):
o Application of classical models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN, Decision Trees) and advanced models (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Neural Network etc.)
o Justification for model selection and tuning strategies

• Model Evaluation (20%):
o Use of appropriate metrics (e.g. Accuracy , Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
o Robustness checks, e.g., backtesting and residual analysis
